# GitGo

GoLang program that goes into every directory of a given location and runs "git fetch" and "git pull"!

Future Plans: After creating this and testing it, this project shows up as a virus and is removed by antivirus. This could be solved by changing the code and the way things are done. Currently on hold while a solution is found.
