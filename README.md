# GitGo

A GoLang program that will jump into every directory at a given location and run "git fetch" and "git pull" in every directory.

Future Plans: After creating this and testing it, this project shows up as a virus and is removed by antivirus. This could be solved by changing the code and the way things are done. Currently on hold while a solution is found.
